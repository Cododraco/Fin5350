## Syllabus

### Course Description

This is a course on computational financial modeling using the Python programming language.
Topics in computational finance as well as financial computing will be covered. Students will
learn computational modeling with applications in finance from corporate finance, investments,
risk management. Foundational concepts from computer science and software engineering will be
introduced. Upon completion of the course students will have a new analytical framework for
thinking about financial problem solving as well as a deep practical skill set in computational
modeling.


### Course Delivery Mode

This course is listed as a blended face-to-face course. There will be both online and in-person
elements to this course. The online content will be both synchronous and asynchronous. I will
post some prerecorded lectures on certain topics on the Canvas page that I expect you to watch
and fully digest. This is the asynchronous portion of the course. Most lectures will be 
screencasts using Zoom video conferencing software. These will be accessible from the Canvas
page. This is the online synchronous portion of the course. I will record these lectures, but 
you are expected to participate in them live while they are given. There will also be times
that I meet with you in smaller project teams face-to-face to guide you and help in completing
your course projects.  

<br>

__Note:__ This is not the first time that I have taught this course in this modality. It is 
actually very well suited for this mode of delivery. I feel that with this course we can
not only adapt to the situation presented by COVID19, but that we can thrive!

<br>

__Note:__ It is entirely possible that all coursework will be moved online campus-wide during
the semester. If that happens we will be well prepared for the situation and adapt quite well
to that scenario. 

<br>

These are unique times. I ask for your patience and cooperation as well as offering mine to
each of you. If we are adaptive, patient, flexible, and determined I am certain that we can
have a wonderful learning experience together this semester. 


### Prerequisites

- STAT 2300 or better
- Math 1100/1210 Calculus
- Finance 3200 and 3400
- __OR__ approval of the professor

Students must be prepared to program in Python for computational assignments. No prior
programming experience is assumed or required. 


### Textbooks

I will provide Jupyter notebooks, handouts, and other readings for course material. So, there
is no ___strictly required___ textbook for the course, but I do suggest the following for 
learning Python programming:



- [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) by Eric Matthes 

- [Python for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition](https://amzn.to/2Zmbjp3) by Mike Dawson

- [Python for Data Analysis](https://amzn.to/2Hqxp3m) by Wes McKinney

<br>
<br>

### Assessment and Grading

Students will be assessed according to the following:

- Preparation, Participation & Citizenship (15%)
- Weekly homework problems (15%)
- Four computational projects (60%)


### Software

Finance 5350 is taught using the Python programming language and the so called *scientific
stack*, a set of core numerical computing packages written and maintained by various third
parties. 

#### Anaconda Python 3 Edition

The main focus of the course is the Python programming for financial modeling. We will be
using the Anaconda Python Distribution, which is free: 

- [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
<br>

We will heavily use both [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [github](https://github.com/).
Installation instructions and some tutorials will be provided. 

<br>

For Finance 5350 we will learn modern document preparation tools:

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

<br>

I will be giving just-in-time tutorials for each of these tools as we need them. 
(Both synchronous and asynchronous). 

**NOT** Microsoft Word! Word is not allowed in Finance 5350!

<br>

#### Slack 

We will use Slack this semester for communication. You can download an app for your phone, or
download a desktop app for your laptop. You can also use Slack in the browser. I will be
inviting you each during the first week of class to the channel at (fin5350-usu.slack.com).
