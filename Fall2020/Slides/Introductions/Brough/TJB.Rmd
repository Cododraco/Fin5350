## What is Catallactics?

\begin{itemize}
 \item[] \textbf{Hayek:} 
  \begin{itemize}
   \item[] "... the order brought about by mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market. 
           A catallaxy is thus the special kind of spontaneous order produced by the market through
           people acting within the rules of the law of property, tort and contract."		   
  \end{itemize} 
 \item[]
 \item[] \textbf{Buchanan:}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item[] "The elementary and basic approach that I suggest places \textit{'the theory of markets'} and
          not the 'theory of resource allocation' at center stage. \textbf{My plea is really for the
		  adoption of a sophisticated \textit{'catallatics'}}."
 \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
