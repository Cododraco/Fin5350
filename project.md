# Finance 5350 Final Project

For the final project you will work in groups of two. I will allow one group of three if there is an odd number of
students. 

You will complete a project on one of two broad topics:

1. Extending an object-oriented option pricing engine. 
2. Extending an object-oriented computational econometric engine.

I will give more details in class.

# Finance 5350 Final Essay

The topic of the essay will be: _What should computational financial economists do?_
