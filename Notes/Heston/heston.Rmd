## The Heston Model

The Heston (1993) model assumes the underlying stock price follows the diffusion process given by:

$$
dS_{t} = \mu S_{t} dt + \sqrt{v_{t}} S_{t} dz_{1,t}
$$
where $\mu$ is the drift parameter, and $z_{1,t}$ is a standard Wiener process. The volatility $\sqrt{v_{t}}$ itself follows a diffusion process:

$$
d\sqrt{v_{t}} = -\beta \sqrt{v_{t}} dt + \delta dz_{2,t}
$$

where $z_{2,t}$ is a Wiener process, and $\rho$ defines the correlation between $z_{1,t}$ and $z{2,t}$. 

Using Ito's lemma the variance process can be written as an Orstein-Uhlenbeck (mean-reverting) process:

$$
dv_{t} = \kappa [\theta - v_{t}] dt + \sigma \sqrt{v_{t}} d z_{2,t}
$$

where

- $\theta = $ the long-run mean of the variance

- $\kappa = $ a mean reversion parameter 

- $\sigma = $ the volatility of volatility

Given this set up the Heston (1993) gives the price of the call option as:

$$
Call(S,v,t) = S_{t} P_{1} - K P(t,T) P_{2}
$$
where

- $S_{t} = $ the spot price of the asset

- $K = $ the strike price of the option

- $P(t,T) = $ a discount factor from time $t$ to time $T$

If we assume a constant rate of interest $r$, we can write this as

$$
P(t,T) = \exp{-r \times (T - t)}
$$

$P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are the probabilities that the call option will expire in-the-money, conditional on the log stock price $x_{t} = ln[S_{t}]$, and on the volatility $v_{t}$, each at time $t$. 

The risk-neutral versions are given by:

$$
\begin{array}
dx_{t} &= [r -\frac{1}{2}v_{t}]dt + \sqrt{v_{t}} dz_{1,t}^{\ast} \\
dv_{t} &= \kappa[\theta - v_{t}]dt + \sigma \sqrt{v_{t}} dz_{2,t}^{\ast}
\end{array}
$$
