title: Computational Financial Modeling 

---

# Software

Finance 5350 is taught using Python and the *Scientific Stack*, a set of core scientific computing packages written and maintained by various third parties.

## Python

The main focus of the course is the Python programming for financial modeling. We will be using the Anaconda Python
Distribution, which is free:

- [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

I will be giving detailed instructions on how to install and get Python running on your system. 

### Data Nitro

[Data Nitro](https://datanitro.com/) has graciously given us free access to their product for the semester. With this powerful tool we will see how to replace VBA with Python and how to use Python as a computational engine for Excel spreadsheets. Installation instructions will be given.

## Git and Github

We will heavily use both `git` and [github](htts://github.io). Installation instructions and some tutorials are given on a separate page.

## Ubuntu Linux 

I will be using and demonstrating the use of a cloud-based linux virtual machine on the [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) platform. It is **strongly encouraged** that you also use such a linux virtual machine, but it is not **strictly required.** I want to be sensitive to cost. Very low-cost options are available. I will give detail instructions for a starting up, connecting to, and using a vm as our computational platform. 

I will also be giving a basic UNIX tutorial. You may also benefit from the following:

- [A Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)
- [UNIX Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/)
- [Berkeley Tutorial](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kevin/unix-tutorial/toc.html)

I will also be using the Vim text editor. I suggest you do too. See here for a tutorial:

- [Open VIM Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)
- [A VIM Tutorial and Primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)


## Document Processing Utilities

For Finance 5350 we will learn modern document preparation tools:

- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

I will be giving just-in-time tutorials for each of these tools as we need them. 

**NOT** Microsoft Word! Word is not allows in Finance 5350!
