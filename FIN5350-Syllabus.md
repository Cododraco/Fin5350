## Syllabus

### Course Description



### Prerequisites


### Textbooks

None of these textbooks are required in the strict sense, but I would suggest that you purchase at least one of the first two and the book on Cython. I will be using them to guide me in the material that I will present. 

- [Python for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition](https://goo.gl/ceSfsG)
- [Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language (2nd Edition)](https://goo.gl/ms5Wgx)
- [Cython: A Guide for Python Programmers](https://goo.gl/xD1YC2)

Philosophically I will be pulling from Zed Shaw's approach (though I will cheat a bit):

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/)

I can also highly suggest for serious students (and I may pull some material) the following:

- [Python in Practice](https://goo.gl/mGq3tB)
- [Numerical Python: A Practical Techniques Approach for Industry](https://goo.gl/2qFBqm)

As you can see, there is no shortage of good books on programming Python, which is one of its great strengths. 


### Assessment and Grading

Students will be assessed according to the following:

- Homework problems and computational assignments (25%)
    + Homework assignments will correspond with your readings
    + Python computational assignments will augment your readings
    
- Replication Projects (25%)
    + You will be asked to replicate the computational aspects of some chosen academic papers
    + [Simulating Supply](http://www2.owen.vanderbilt.edu/nick.bollen/research/nw4.PDF) by Bollen and Whaley
    + [Performance of Statistical Arbitrage in Petroleum Futures Markets](https://goo.gl/6rSMqh) by Alizadeh & Nomikos 
    + The deliverable will be a markdown document consisting of the essay and Python code 

- A final project (40%)
    + Students may work in teams of two
    + Project topics will be announced
    + The deliverable will be a markdown with paper and code combined
    
- A final essay (10%)
    + Topic: "What Should (Computational) Economists Do?"
    + I will discuss this with you in class
    + The deliverable will be an markdown document 

Dates for each of these stages will be discussed in class and updated on the Google Sheet schedule. All work will handed in through GitHub.
