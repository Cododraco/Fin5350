title: Computational Financial Modeling 

---

# Course Synopsis

This is a course on computational financial modeling using the Python programming language. Topics in computational
finance as well as financial computing will be covered. Students will learn computational modeling with applications to
option pricing and financial econometrics. Foundational concepts from computer science and software engineering will be
introduced. Upon completion of the course students will have a new analytical framework for thinking about financial
problem solving as well as a deep practical skill set in computational modeling.

### Prerequisites

- Statistics 2000/2300 Business Statistics 
- Math 1100 or 1210 Calculus
- Finance 3200 and 3400
- Or approval of the professor

Students must be prepared to program in Python for computational assignments. No prior programming experience is
required!
