# Textbook and Reading Materials

There is not a *required* textbook for this course. I will provide many notes, tutorials, and links to documentation.

## Learning Python

### Python Tutorials

We will be following a combination of the following (*free*) Python tutorials:

- [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp) by Jake VanderPlas. 
- [The Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/py/index.html)
- [Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics, and Data Analysis](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/0/09/Python_introduction.pdf) by Kevin Sheppard.

### Beginning Python Books

- [Python for the Absolute Beginner](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Absolute-Beginner-3rd/dp/1435455002)
	+ While the subject of this book is game programming, it teaches real programming. I haven't yet found a better way for
	  someone with no experience to learn to program. The author's approach to programming pedagogy is impressive.

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
	+ I am a big fan of Shaw, and especially his hard-way approach. Although he is a bit of a [character](http://programming-motherfucker.com/).

## Supporting Material

The following are not required, but suggested for the serious student, especially if you are considering graduate
school. I will present some material based on them.

### Weekly Readings

Students will be assigned one or more papers to be read during the week prior to the lecture in which they will be discussed.

### Additional References Python  

The following are not required, but I will present some material based on these readings in the financial computing portion of the lectures. 

- [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do?code=WKDATASC) by Wes McKinney
- [Numerical Python](https://jrjohansson.github.io/numericalpython.html) by Robert Johansson. 


### Additional Resources for Algorithms and Numerical Methods

The following are not required, but I will present some material based on these readings in the computational finance portion of the lectures. 

- [How to Count](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava.
- [Grokking Algorithms](http://sites.fastspring.com/stevenf/product/howtocountpdf) by Steven Frank.
- [Numerical Methods in Finance and Economics](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471745030.html) by Paolo Brandimarte.
- [Numerical Methods of Statistics 2nd Edition]() by John Monahan.
