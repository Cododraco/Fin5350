# Textbook and Reading Materials

There is not a *required* textbook for this course. I will provide many notes, tutorials, and links to documentation.
However, I do strongly suggest the following two books. I will be basing a good portion of my lecture material upon
these sources:

- [Python for the Absolute Beginner]()
- [Numerical Python](https://jrjohansson.github.io/numericalpython.html) by Robert Johansson. 

### Supporting Material

The following are not required, but suggested for the serious student, especially if you are considering graduate
school. I will present some material based on them.


### Weekly Readings

Students will be assigned one or more papers to be read during the week prior to the lecture in which they will be discussed.

### Additional References

The following are not required, but I may present material based on them. 

[Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do?code=WKDATASC) by Wes McKinney
