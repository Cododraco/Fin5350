# Grading and Assignments

Students will be assesed according to the following:

- Participation and professionalism (30%)
	+ It is essential that you actively participate in class discussions and demonstrate professional behavior. No
	  student can earn an A grade without this!
	+ Weekly programming, writing, and reading assignments.
	+ Assignments must be submitted as Jupyter notebooks, or markdown or latex files. Handwritten or Word documents will
	  not be accepted.
- A final computational project (40%)
	+ You can work in groups of two. I will allow one group of three if there is an odd number of students (but I must
	  approve the group).
- A final essay (30%)  
	+ Topic: *What should computational financial economists do?* (see [Buchanan(1964)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1055931?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)


All work will be submitted electronically via students' private GitHub repositories. Instructions will be given on how
to set up and use GitHub.

The final projects and essays will be submitted in multiple states: 

- Proposal
- Rough draft
- Final submission

Dates for each of these will be discussed in class and updated on the class Google Sheet schedule.

I will allow students to hand in work multiple times until a student receives 100% on each assignment. I will keep
track of the number of submissions and that will enter students' final grade. It is important to me that you actually
acquire the skills outlined in the intended outcomes of the course!
