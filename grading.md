# Grading and Assignments

Students will be assesed according to the following:

- Weekly programming, writing, and reading assignments 
	+ Assignments must be submitted as Jupyter notebooks, or markdown or latex files. Handwritten or Word documents will
	  not be accepted.
- A final computational project 
	+ You can work in groups of two. I will allow one group of three if there is an odd number of students (but I must
	  approve the group).
- A final essay 
	+ Topic: *What should computational financial economists do?* (see [Buchanan(1964)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1055931?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)

All work will be submitted electronically via students' private GitHub repositories. Instructions will be given on how
to set up and use GitHub.
